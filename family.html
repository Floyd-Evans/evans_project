      <p>Granted, they are grown up now and no longer this small. We decided to go for a
        stroll that day. Pictured are five of my six. From left to right: Mitzi, Abbagail,
        Angelina, Floyd Jr., and Tabitha.

      <p>For the most part, we have gotten used to the crazy Iowa weather. Warm and sunny

        do not plan on going back. Iowa is friendly and a great place to raise a family or
        simply slow down and grow some corn.
