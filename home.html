      <p>Hello, my name is Floyd Evans Sr and I live in Iowa with my wife Mitzi and five of my six children.
        My children are named Floyd Jr, Angelina, Abbagail, D'mitri, Mitzi and Tabitha. Seems like only yesterday
        that my children were small and dependent on me and their mother for a lot, but that has changed. As you may
        be able to tell from some of the content here, we enjoy travelling whenever we can. We tend to drive more than
        we fly as we are such a large family, and that makes it even more fun as we get to spend more time together.</p>

      <p>Who am I? I like to travel, both break and fix things, as well as engineer and fashion contraptions in my
        garage.
        I enjoy the challenge of creating solution at work and drive it from start to finish. When I am not
        intentionally
        breaking things to see how they function, I work at ACT Inc as a Software Engineer and enjoy the challenge that
        it
        brings when we have to devise solutions and the satisfaction when my projects are complete. Well, that is as
        complete as software can be as there is always maintenance and upgrades. Over the years at work I have adopted
        the
        mindset that I should "fail fast and fail often." This tells me that I am moving and if I fail, I know that I am
        moving in the right direction.
